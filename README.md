AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description
This project is part of the AlX foundation and focuses on creating a command-line interpreter for managing objects in the AirBnB clone application. The command interpreter handles the creation, modification, and deletion of objects and serves as the backbone of the future web application.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter mimics a shell environment but is tailored for managing AirBnB objects such as `User`, `Place`, `State`, etc. It provides several commands for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting instances.

### How to Start the Command Interpreter
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://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@github.com/FRANKD-UX/sorting_algorithms.git
